description: Run all linting, type checking, tests, Markdown lint, and documentation build for the project. Check for errors and warnings, then fix any problems found. Use when the user asks to run checks, verify the build, run CI locally, or fix lint/type/test errors.

# Run All Checks

Execute all project checks (lint, typecheck, test, Markdown lint, docs) and fix any errors found. This skill aligns with the `scripts/run-all-checks.sh` script and a standard Python package layout (e.g. `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`).

## The script controls which checks are enabled

`scripts/run-all-checks.sh` is the **single source of truth** for which checks a given repo runs. The set of checks MUST be consistent across this skill (the AI), the CI/CD pipeline, and the script — and the script is authoritative.

- Run the checks the script actually runs, and **only** those. If a check listed in this skill (e.g. a docs build, Markdown lint, or coverage gate) is not enabled in the script for this repo, it does NOT need to be run as part of the skill — skip it rather than running it anyway.
- Treat the commands and tools in this skill as the typical default set. When the script and this skill disagree, follow the script.
- If you believe a check should be added or removed, change it in `scripts/run-all-checks.sh` first (and keep CI/CD in step with it), rather than running an out-of-band check from the skill.

## Quick Start

1. Run all checks (optionally in parallel via the script).
2. Review output for errors and warnings.
3. Fix any issues found.
4. Re-run checks to verify fixes.

## Check Commands

Run from **project root** with the project **virtual environment activated** (e.g. `source venv/bin/activate` or create a new venv and then `pip install -e ".[dev]"`).

### Code (ruff, flake8, mypy, pytest, stubtest, pip-audit)

```bash
# Lint (ruff); `ruff format` is disabled because it would remove deliberate alignment
python -m ruff check src tests

# Continuation-line indentation, which ruff does not implement
python -m flake8 --select=E12,E13 src tests

# Type check (mypy on tests only; src/ is deliberately unannotated)
MYPYPATH=src python -m mypy tests

# Tests (pytest; use -n auto for parallel when tests are independent)
python -m pytest tests -q

# The published stub matches the runtime API
python -m mypy.stubtest vicar --mypy-config-file pyproject.toml --allowlist .stubtest-allowlist

# Known vulnerabilities in dependencies (pip-audit)
python -m pip_audit --skip-editable
```

The run-all-checks script runs these in sequence; use the script’s `-c` option to run only code checks.

### Text (codespell, PyMarkdown)

```bash
# Spelling: typos and British spellings
python -m codespell_lib src tests docs scripts README.md CONTRIBUTING.md

# Markdown lint
python -m pymarkdown scan -r docs/ .claude/ README.md CONTRIBUTING.md
```

Use the script’s `-m` option to run both text checks, or `--codespell` /
`--pymarkdown` to run one of them.

### Documentation (Sphinx)

```bash
cd docs && make clean && make html SPHINXOPTS="-W -n"
```

Warnings are treated as errors (`-W`), and nitpicky mode (`-n`) reports every cross-reference that doesn't resolve. The script’s `-d` option runs the docs build plus the text checks.

## Using the Script

From project root:

```bash
./scripts/run-all-checks.sh
```

Options:

- **Default**: Run code checks and docs (Sphinx + PyMarkdown) in parallel.
- `-c, --code`: Only the code checks (ruff, flake8 continuation-line indent, mypy, pytest, stubtest, pip-audit).
- `-d, --docs`: Only the Sphinx build and the text checks (codespell, PyMarkdown).
- `-m, --markdown`: Only the text checks; `--codespell` or `--pymarkdown` for one of them.
- `-s, --sequential`: Run code and docs sequentially (easier to read output).
- `-p, --parallel`: Run code and docs in parallel (the default).
- `-h, --help`: Show usage.

Set `VENV` or `VENV_PATH` to point to the virtual environment if it is not at `./venv`.

## Execution Workflow

```text
Check Progress:
- [ ] Ruff check (src, tests)
- [ ] Flake8 continuation-line indent (src, tests)
- [ ] Mypy (tests)
- [ ] Pytest (tests)
- [ ] Stubtest (__init__.pyi)
- [ ] pip-audit (installed dependencies)
- [ ] codespell (src, tests, docs, scripts, README, CONTRIBUTING)
- [ ] PyMarkdown scan (docs/, .claude/, README, CONTRIBUTING)
- [ ] Sphinx build (docs/) with SPHINXOPTS="-W -n"
- [ ] All errors fixed
- [ ] Re-verify all checks pass
```

### Step 1: Run Checks

Use the script (recommended) or run the commands above manually. Fix any non-zero exit codes.

### Step 2: Analyze Results

- **Errors**: Must be fixed (non-zero exit).
- **Warnings**: Sphinx is run with `-W -n`, so docs warnings, including unresolved cross-references, fail the check; fix them so the build passes.

Common error types:

| Check   | Error pattern              | Typical fix                    |
|---------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| ruff    | `F401` unused import       | Remove import                  |
| ruff    | `ARG001` unused argument   | Prefix with `_` or add noqa    |
| mypy    | `error: Name "X" not defined` | Add import or fix typo      |
| pytest  | `FAILED` / `ERROR`        | Fix test or code under test   |
| pymarkdown | Rule ID + message       | Fix Markdown style/structure   |
| codespell | `word ==> correction`   | Fix the spelling. If the word is correct here, add it to `ignore-words-list` in `pyproject.toml` (with a comment saying why) or mark that line `codespell:ignore <word>` |
| sphinx  | `WARNING: duplicate object` | Add `:no-index:` or fix refs |
| sphinx  | `reference target not found` | Fix the reference, or add the package to `intersphinx_mapping` |
| pip-audit | Package, version, and vulnerability ID | Raise the minimum version in `pyproject.toml` |
| pip-audit | Vulnerability in `pip` or `setuptools` | Upgrade them in the virtual environment (`pip install --upgrade pip setuptools`) |

### Step 3: Fix Issues

For each error: read the message, open the file and line, apply the fix. Re-run the failing check to confirm.

### Step 4: Re-verify

Run the full script again; all checks should pass (exit code 0).

## Common Fixes Reference

### Ruff unused argument (ARG001)

For fixtures that are dependencies but not directly used:

```python
def my_fixture(other_fixture: None) -> None:  # noqa: ARG001
    ...
```

### Sphinx duplicate object warning

Add `:no-index:` to the automodule directive where appropriate:

```rst
.. automodule:: mypackage.module
   :members:
   :no-index:
```

### Coverage threshold

If coverage is below the project target (90%; see `python_testing.md`): add tests or, temporarily, adjust `[tool.coverage.report]` / threshold in config. Prefer adding tests.

### Type annotation issues

For forward reference or union syntax issues:

```python
from __future__ import annotations  # at top of file
```

## Success Criteria

All checks pass when:

- `ruff check` → All checks passed
- `flake8 --select=E12,E13` → No output
- `mypy` → Success: no issues found
- `pytest` → All tests pass; coverage meets target if configured
- `stubtest` → Success: no issues found
- `pip-audit` → No known vulnerabilities found
- `codespell` → No misspellings reported
- `pymarkdown scan` → No violations
- `make html SPHINXOPTS="-W -n"` (in docs/) → Build completes with exit 0
